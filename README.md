# 2dSwingGameEngine
This is a simple passion project of mine to build my skills in project building.


##TODO
 - Make code more efficient
 - Improve the if else if statements. To make the code less clunky
 - Add comments
 - Build Collision system for entities, not just the world borders
 - Add a UI for a new world, load world etc
 - add music system.
 - Add Camera System.
 - Optimize character movement
 - Fix jumping system with gravity (Infinite jump, weird reaction when moving to diff directions.
 - 
##FUTURE PLANS
 - Support Top view 2d camera (reason why i  added disable gravity system etc)
 - add sprite loader so i could use images for characters and buildings in the world
 - Add enemy support.
 - Add enemy npc movement support.
 - Make world bigger than what the current frame allows.
 - Add a level editor (Hence the game engine part of this project).
